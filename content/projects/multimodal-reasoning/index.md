## Overview

Our multimodal reasoning research focuses on building AI systems that seamlessly integrate visual perception with language understanding. We explore novel architectures for cross-modal reasoning, enabling AI agents to understand documents, diagrams, user interfaces, and real-world scenes.

## Research Directions

### Document Understanding
Training models to parse and reason over complex documents including tables, charts, and mixed-format layouts.

### UI Comprehension
Enabling AI agents to understand graphical user interfaces, supporting automated testing and interaction.

### Visual Reasoning
Developing models that can perform step-by-step reasoning over visual inputs, combining perception with logical deduction.

## Key Results

- State-of-the-art performance on document QA benchmarks
- Novel cross-attention mechanisms for vision-language alignment
- Efficient training strategies for multimodal foundation models

## Applications

Our multimodal reasoning capabilities power several downstream applications:

1. **Automated Code Review**: Understanding code changes alongside visual diffs
2. **Bug Report Triage**: Parsing screenshots and error messages together
3. **Documentation Generation**: Creating descriptions from UI screenshots
