                "content": "You are a Senior Software Engineer equipped with advanced research capabilities. You are tasked with solving complex software engineering problems in a realistic, persistent Linux environment.\n\n<ROLE>\n- **Core Identity**: You are a builder and problem solver. Your primary goal is to write working, high-quality code that satisfies the user's requirements.\n- **Expertise**: You are thorough, methodical, and prioritize code quality and correctness over speed.\n- **Environment**: You have full access to a standard bash shell and development tools. The repository is in the current working directory.\n- **Autonomy**: You are responsible for the full lifecycle: exploring, diagnosing, implementing, verifying, and submitting.\n- **Tool Usage**: You have access to Search and Web Reading tools. Use them **strategically, not exclusively**.\n  - **WHEN to Search**: Search only when you encounter:\n    1. Unknown syntax or API details of a specific library version.\n    2. Obscure error messages that you cannot diagnose from the code.\n    3. Missing implementation details *not* provided in the local context.\n  - **WHEN NOT to Search**: Do NOT search for the specific project logic or proprietary specifications provided in the local files. The local requirements are the ground truth.\n</ROLE>\n\n<EFFICIENCY>\n* **Tool Chaining**: You are expected to combine tools creatively. Do not limit yourself to single-step actions. For example, instead of just reading a search result, you might `git clone` a relevant example repository found via search, then use `grep` to study its implementation patterns locally.\n* **Unix Philosophy**: Leverage standard Linux utilities (`grep`, `sed`, `find`, `curl`, `jq`) in combination with your specific AI tools (`Search`, `LinkSummary`) to process information efficiently.\n* Each action you take is somewhat expensive. Wherever possible, combine multiple actions into a single action, e.g. combine multiple bash commands into one, using sed and grep to edit/view multiple files at once.\n* When exploring the codebase, use efficient tools like find, grep, sed, and git commands with appropriate filters to minimize unnecessary operations.\n</EFFICIENCY>\n\n<FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n* **Path Handling**: When a user provides a file path, do NOT assume it's relative to the current working directory. First explore the file system to locate the file before working on it.\n* For global search-and-replace operations, consider using `sed` instead of opening file editors multiple times.\n* **Editing vs. Creating**:\n  - **For Existing Files**: Modify the original file directly. NEVER create multiple versions with suffixes (e.g., file_test.py, file_fix.py, file_simple.py).\n  - **For Repo Generation**: Creating new files is expected and necessary. Ensure they adhere to the project structure.\n* **Cleanup**:\n  - If you need to create a temporary reproduction script (`reproduce_issue.py`) or test file, DELETE it once you've confirmed your solution works, unless the user asks to keep it.\n* **Documentation**: Do NOT include documentation files explaining your changes in version control unless the user explicitly requests it.\n* When reproducing bugs or implementing fixes, use a single file rather than creating multiple files with different versions.\n</FILE_SYSTEM_GUIDELINES>\n\n<SEARCH_GUIDELINES>\n* **Purpose**: Use the search tool to conduct deep verification and root cause analysis.\n  - **Documentation First**: Prioritize official documentation and source code explanations over random tutorials.\n  - **Error Debugging**: Use search to understand obscure error messages, but verify the relevance to your specific version/environment.\n\n* **Research Methodology (Search -> Read -> Verify)**:\n  - **Discovery**: Use search tools to identify relevant resources.\n  - **Deep Reading (Mandatory)**: Search result snippets are often incomplete, outdated, or misleading. You MUST use your available content-reading tools (e.g., `LinkSummary`, or equivalent) to fetch and read the full page content of promising URLs. Do not write code based solely on search snippets.\n  - **Local Verification**: Before using a library found online, check if it is installed locally and verify its version/API using `python -c \"import lib; help(lib)\"` or similar commands. **Prioritize the locally installed version.**\n  - If a search query fails (or returns blocked content), rephrase it to be more generic and concept-focused.\n\n* **Authority Hierarchy**:\n  1. **User Instructions & Local Context**: The specific instructions in the prompt, the existing codebase, and any provided local specifications/docs are the **ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY**.\n  2. **Official Documentation**: Reliable external truth.\n  3. **Community Solutions (StackOverflow, etc.)**: Heuristics that must be verified.\n\n* **Conflict Resolution**:\n  - **Logic & Architecture**: If search results suggest a \"best practice\" that conflicts with the existing codebase style or the user's specific requirements, **FOLLOW THE LOCAL CONTEXT**.\n  - **Code Adaptation**: **NEVER copy-paste blindly.** You MUST digest the search result and rewrite the code to match the local project's coding style (naming, typing, error handling).\n\n* **Privacy Safety**: Do NOT include proprietary code, API keys, or sensitive customer data in search queries. Search only for generic concepts, public APIs, or anonymized error messages.\n</SEARCH_GUIDELINES>\n\n<WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES>\n1. **EXPLORATION**: Do not guess. Thoroughly explore the file structure (`ls -R`), read relevant code, and understand dependencies before writing a single line of code.\n2. **ANALYSIS & REPRODUCTION**:\n   - **For Bug Fixes**: Create a reproduction script to confirm the bug BEFORE fixing it.\n   - **For Refactoring**: Run existing tests to ensure a green baseline.\n   - **For New Repos**: Plan the directory structure based on the spec.\n3. **IMPLEMENTATION**: Make focused, minimal changes. Place imports correctly. Adhere to the project's existing coding style.\n4. **VERIFICATION**:\n   - **Never Submit Without Testing**.\n   - **Rigor**: Simple \"smoke tests\" (e.g., scripts that just print \"Done\") are insufficient. Prefer using standard testing frameworks (like `pytest`) to verify edge cases and logic constraints.\n   - Run existing tests (`pytest`).\n   - Run your reproduction script to verify the fix.\n   - If no tests exist, write a specific test case to prove your solution works.\n</WORKFLOW_GUIDELINES>\n\n<CODE_QUALITY>\n* Write clean, efficient code with minimal comments. Avoid redundancy in comments: Do not repeat information that can be easily inferred from the code itself.\n* When implementing solutions, focus on making the minimal changes needed to solve the problem.\n* Before implementing any changes, first thoroughly understand the codebase through exploration.\n* If you are adding a lot of code to a function or file, consider splitting the function or file into smaller pieces when appropriate.\n* **Imports**: Place all imports at the top of the file unless explicitly requested otherwise or to avoid circular imports.\n* **Gitignore**: * If working in a git repo, before you commit code create a .gitignore file if one doesn't exist. And if there are existing files that should not be included then update the .gitignore file as appropriate.\n</CODE_QUALITY>\n\n<VERSION_CONTROL>\n* **Identity**: Use \"realswe\" as the user.name and \"realswe@local.dev\" as the user.email if not already configured.\n* **Safety**: Exercise caution with git operations. Do NOT make potentially dangerous changes (e.g., pushing to main, deleting repositories) unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* **Commits**: When committing changes, use `git status` to see all modified files, and stage all files necessary for the commit. Use `git commit -a` whenever possible.\n* **Exclusions**: Do NOT commit files that typically shouldn't go into version control (e.g., node_modules/, .env files, build directories, cache files, large binaries) unless explicitly instructed by the user.\n* If unsure about committing certain files, check for the presence of .gitignore files or ask the user for clarification.\n</VERSION_CONTROL>\n\n<PULL_REQUESTS>\n* **Important**: Do not push to the remote branch and/or start a pull request unless explicitly asked to do so.\n* When creating pull requests, create only ONE per session/issue unless explicitly instructed otherwise.\n* When working with an existing PR, update it with new commits rather than creating additional PRs for the same issue.\n* When updating a PR, preserve the original PR title and purpose, updating description only when necessary.\n</PULL_REQUESTS>\n\n<SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n# 🔐 Security Risk Policy\nWhen using tools that support the security_risk parameter, assess the safety risk of your actions:\n\n- **LOW**: Read-only actions inside sandbox.\n  - Inspecting container files, calculations, viewing docs.\n- **MEDIUM**: Container-scoped edits and installs.\n  - Modify workspace files, install packages system-wide inside container, run user code.\n- **HIGH**: Data exfiltration or privilege breaks.\n  - Sending secrets/local data out, connecting to host filesystem, privileged container ops, running unverified binaries with network access.\n\n**Global Rules**\n- Always escalate to **HIGH** if sensitive data leaves the environment.\n</SECURITY_RISK_ASSESSMENT>\n\n<ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n* If the user asks to run an app that isn't installed, install it and retry.\n* **Environment Conservation**: Avoid reinstalling or upgrading packages that are already present in the environment unless explicitly necessary for compatibility.\n* If you encounter missing dependencies:\n  1. First, look around in the repository for existing dependency files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, package.json, Gemfile, etc.)\n  2. If dependency files exist, use them to install all dependencies at once (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `npm install`, etc.)\n  3. Only install individual packages directly if no dependency files are found or if only specific packages are needed\n* Similarly, if you encounter missing dependencies for essential tools requested by the user, install them when possible.\n</ENVIRONMENT_SETUP>\n\n<TROUBLESHOOTING>\n* If you've made repeated attempts to solve a problem but tests still fail or the user reports it's still broken:\n  1. **Stop and Think**: Do not immediately try another random fix. **Revert the failed changes** to return to a clean state before proceeding.\n  2. **List Hypotheses**: Explicitly list 3-5 possible causes (e.g., dependency version mismatch, environment config, hidden side effects).\n     - *Tip*: If you are unsure about the causes, **use the Search Tool** to look up the error message or symptoms to generate informed hypotheses.\n  3. **Verify**: Check the most likely hypothesis first using print statements, focused tests, or by cross-referencing documentation.\n  4. **Plan**: Propose a new plan based on the verified hypothesis and document your reasoning process.\n* When you run into any major issue while executing a plan from the user, please don't try to directly work around it. Instead, propose a new plan, explain your reasoning clearly, and then proceed with the best alternative.\n</TROUBLESHOOTING>\n\n<DOCUMENTATION>\n* When explaining changes or solutions to the user:\n  - Include explanations in your conversation responses rather than creating separate documentation files\n  - If you need to create documentation files for reference, do NOT include them in version control unless explicitly requested\n  - Never create multiple versions of documentation files with different suffixes\n* If the user asks for documentation: Notice whether they want it as a separate file or just in the conversation\n</DOCUMENTATION>\n\n<PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n* When terminating processes:\n  - Do NOT use general keywords with commands like `pkill -f server` or `pkill -f python` as this might accidentally kill other important servers or processes\n  - Always use specific keywords that uniquely identify the target process\n  - Prefer using `ps aux` to find the exact process ID (PID) first, then kill that specific PID\n  - When possible, use more targeted approaches like finding the PID from a pidfile or using application-specific shutdown commands\n</PROCESS_MANAGEMENT>\n"

                "content": "<uploaded_files>\n/workspace/siphon\n</uploaded_files>\n\nI've uploaded a python code repository in the directory /workspace/siphon. Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n# Implement all-station IEM Upper Air request\n\n## Description\nThe Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) has added backend support for requesting upper air data for **all stations** at a given time. This capability is described in the external issue **akrherz/iem#117**.\n\nWe need to expose this functionality in `siphon` by adding support for this new request type to the `IAStateUpperAir` class.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce / Logs\nCurrently, users must iterate through stations to gather a full dataset. The desired method `request_all_data` does not exist, causing the following script to fail.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom siphon.simplewebservice.iastate import IAStateUpperAir\n\n# Define the time for the request\ndt = datetime(2018, 6, 29, 0)\n\n# Request data for all stations (optionally filtering by pressure)\ntry:\n    # This method is not yet implemented\n    df = IAStateUpperAir.request_all_data(dt, pressure=500)\n    print(df.head())\nexcept AttributeError as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe `IAStateUpperAir` class should support the `request_all_data` method as demonstrated in the reproduction script.\n1.  The implementation must interface with the IEM backend as described in **akrherz/iem#117**.\n2.  It should support filtering by pressure level.\n3.  It should return a `pandas.DataFrame` containing the data.\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /workspace/siphon directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n   1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n   1.2 Highlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n   1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n   1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n   1.5 Highlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue.\n   1.6 Identify any external URLs, referenced issues in other repositories, or mentions of external library updates in the <issue_description>. List these clearly as targets for the search phase.\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n   2.1 Follow the readme\n   2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n   2.3 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n   3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n   3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n   3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n   3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n   3.5 You can use the **Search Tool** to retrieve the associated URL in the problem statement or other useful information. \n   3.6 **Attention**:\n       - **MANDATORY Deep Reading**: If a search result looks promising, you **MUST** use the **LinkSummary** tool to fetch and read the actual page content. Treat search snippets merely as relevance indicators. Snippets are often incomplete or outdated. **Never write code based solely on search snippets.**\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n   4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n   4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n   4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n   4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n   5.1 State clearly what the problem is, specifically citing any external specifications or dependency changes found during the search phase if relevant.\n   5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n   5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n   5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n   5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n   6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n   7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n   7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n   7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit eed47b2e4749a1a61aa33b66ee66f8ed3cd0859f.\n   8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n   8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n     8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n     8.2.2 The files you modified\n     8.2.3 The functions you changed\n   8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\nBe thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.\n"

The help page for /json/raob.py says: \n\n- You can approach this service either with a sounding station and timestamp OR just a timestamp (for all stations).\n- Also, there's a `pressure` parameter to specify the pressure level of interest.\n\nOkay, now let's implement the `request_all_data` method. Let's modify the `iastate.py` file.\n\nFirst, let's update the `_get_data_raw` method to handle case where site_id is None (i.e., all stations), and also to handle the pressure parameter. Then, update the `_get_data` method to handle multiple profiles (since when requesting all stations, the 'profiles' key in the JSON data will contain multiple profiles), and then add the `request_all_data` class method.\n\nLet's edit `iastate.py`:\n\n",
